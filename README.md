### üìñ About The Project

Short description:
- **Purpose:** To make process of browsing and tracking car listings on www.mobile.de marketplace easier.
- **Key features:** user friendly and responsive mobile app, web screpper built with puppeteer, local notifications, background process.

### üí° Inspiration
-About a year ago i was asked by car deler who buys cars using mobile.de to build him mobile app that would help him track car listings and get notified about relevant changes. Back then i was not able to build it but i gave myself a challange to someday build it and that day has come!

-The idea is to enter search criteria for cars of your interest. Then application using web scraper (since mobile.de doesn't have API for that) takes data from their site and stores it in local SQLite database. It is also possible to remove specific listing from that list or to "Park" it which saves it to bookmarked and marks it as "specialy interesting".
